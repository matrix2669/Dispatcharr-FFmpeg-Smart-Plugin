# Branches

This ledger records why every current long-lived or work branch exists and preserves the context needed for review. GitHub remains authoritative for live refs, commits, pull requests, and checks.

## Maintenance rules

- Add or update a record before substantive work begins on a branch.
- Refresh observed heads and validation before using a record for review or promotion.
- Before deleting a branch, transfer user-visible results to `CHANGELOG.md` and durable rationale to `DECISIONS.md`, then remove its record.
- Treat `main` as production-ready and `dev` as next-version integration.

## Branch index

| Branch | Type | Status | Base | Target | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` | long-lived | active | initial project history | stable releases | Production-ready plugin source and GitHub Releases. |
| `dev` | long-lived | active | `main` | `main` | Integrate and validate the next plugin version and canonical wrapper updates. |

## Branch records

### `main`

- Purpose: production-ready plugin source, stable tags, and explicitly approved GitHub Releases.
- Current release: `v0.1.0`.
- Distribution: eligible for `dispatcharr-plugins:main` only when the corresponding GitHub Release is explicitly approved.
- Last verified state: approved administrative baseline through `f3e15b6` plus the branch-ledger promotion update.
- Last verified at: `2026-08-22`.

### `dev`

- Purpose: integrate and validate the next plugin version before stable promotion to `main`.
- Base: synchronized with `main` after the approved administrative promotion.
- Intended target: `main` after future version work is reviewed and approved.
- Current state: integrates persistent external state and required-cache errors for `v0.2.0-beta.1`.
- Validation: 17 unit tests, Python/JSON/shell checks, immutable wrapper pin verification, repeat synchronization, stable runtime layout, and installed Dispatcharr validation pass. The existing cache and probe sample remained unchanged outside the replaced plugin directory, and missing/stale cache requests return identified exit-78 errors.
- Publication state: beta source tag only; no GitHub Release or distributable ZIP is authorized. The `dispatcharr-plugins:dev` registry may advertise this immutable beta.
- Last verified at: `2026-08-22`.
